# Vasinator Database
Vatsinator Database is an open to everyone service that lets you have contribution in what Vatsinator can recognize.
In contains airports, Flight Information Regions, airlines and more. Handling such big amount of data is impossible for
only one person - and this is where the community comes.

## Project
The VatsinatorDatabase project is officially hosted on [database.vatsinator.eu.org](http://database.vatsinator.eu.org).
This GitHub page is used to host the source code only.

## Status
Currently, it is too early to talk about any alpha- or beta-testing. The project still needs a lot of features and improvements
in order to provide complete set of tools. Its development, however, is independent from [Vatsinator](https://github.com/Vatsinator/Vatsinator)'s.
